# Exercise 3: Data Frame Practice with `dplyr`.
# Use a different appraoch to accomplish the same tasks as exercise-1


# Install devtools package: allows installations from GitHub

# Which Accura model has the best hwy MPG in 2015? (without method chaining)
acura.2015 <- filter(vehicles, make == "Acura") %>%
                  filter(vehicles, year == 2015)

# Which Accura model has the best hwy MPG in 2015? (nesting functions)


# Which Accura model has the best hwy MPG in 2015? (pipe operator)


### Bonus ###

# Write 3 functions, one for each approach.  Then, 
# Test how long it takes to perform each one 1000 times
